# drift-fx-jogl
A modified drift-fx implementation for integrating javafx with opengl on jogl
Drift-fx is available here: https://github.com/eclipse-efx/efxclipse-drift

Support for java 11 is included and the maven setup is a multi-release jar, but the java 11 is mostly untested.

This was forked from the very first released code and is mostly for personal projects, don't expect much support. When time permits, I will try to upstream if desired.
